# Chebyshev Picard Iteration

IVP propagation via Picard iteration on Chebyshev polynomials. A redux of key
results is presented in `lecture.{tex,pdf}` while a more thorough construction
is pursued in `notes.{tex,pdf}`. The intent is that the lecture be given either
by itself for high-level audiences, or supplemented with the notes (talked
through live on blackboard) for lower level audiences with the patience and
interest to fully engage with the math.
